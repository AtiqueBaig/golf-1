1> Ethernet frame

* Source MAC address: 
00 13 10 e8 dd 52

* Destination MAC address:
00 27 10 21 fa 48

* Protocol : 
The 13th and 14th bytes holds the EtherType :08 06 -> Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

* Last 2 fields :
First of all, the payload is 28 bytes and since the EtherType is ARP this means we are working with Ipv4.
The 20th byte holds the lenght of the protocol address (4), and folowing the ARP encaspsulated packet structure, the last 4 bytes represents the last 2 fields of the ARP payload that holds the Target Protocol Address (TPA)
wich in this case is : c0 a8 02 67 converted to decimal 192 168 2 103. This means that the target IP is 192.168.2.103.

2> Cable Issue

Using 
The speed of light value of : 299792458 m/s
Cable lenght of 20m

In the case of a 100Mb/s :
1ns -> 2.99 m
x   -> 20 m

x = 20/2.99 ns
x = 6.68 ns

Wich means it will take 6.68ns for the first bit to travel 20 m for 100Mb/s ethernet card

In the case of 10Mb/s, we assume that it will take ~10 times the time it took for the 100Mb/s ethernet card:
1ns -> 0.29 m
x   -> 20 m

x = 20/0.29 ns
x = 68.9 ns

Wich means it will take 68.9ns for the first bit to travel 20 m for 10Mb/s ethernet card

3>Basic network tools
Using windows

**In the Dorm
* The % packet loss if at all it happened after sending 100 packets using the command : 
ping -n 100 www.wikipedia.org
image : ping100packets.png
image result : ping100packets_result.png

* Size of the packet sent to Wikipedia server can be specified by the following command (default is 32 bit):
ping -l 2000 www.wikipedia.org
image : pingWithPacketSize.png

* IP address of your machine and the Wikipedia server:

localhost : using the command ipconfig : 172.16.5.146
image : ipconfigLocalhost.png

wikipedia.org : using nslookup (dig not available for windows) 91.198.174.192
image : nslookupWikipedia.png

* Query Time for DNS query of the above url. TODO (need linux, still looking for an alternative for windows)

* Number of Hops in between your machine and the server 
using the command tracert (windows alt for traceroute) : 12
image : traceroute.png

* MAC address of the device that is acting as your network gateway.
using the command ipconfig /all : F0-92-1C-4E-8A-9E
